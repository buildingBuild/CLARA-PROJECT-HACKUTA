**CLARA** is an AI assitance tool that doesnâ€™t just give answers she explains them with clarity, patience, and presence, using a **realistic voice** and a **human face** that delivers thoughtful, verbal explanations.

CLARA â€“ Codified Linguistic Assistant for Reflective AwarenessÂ Â 
A calm, intelligent face that explains what you donâ€™t understand â€” with voice and thoughful expressions, not just text.

## ðŸŽ¬ How It Works

1. **Ask a question** or paste something you donâ€™t understand
2. **CLARA thinks** â€” generating a clear explanation using Google Gemini
3. **She speaks** the answer via ElevenLabs
4. **You watch her face** explain it through D-ID animation
5. _(Optional)_ She can email you a the summary to review later

## ðŸ’¡ Why CLARA?

Most AI tools talk _at_ you.Â Â 
**CLARA talks _to_ you.**
When youâ€™re stuck, she doesnâ€™t throw text at you.Â Â 
She **speaks**, so you can **understand**.

She gives voice to understanding â€” and a face to learning.Â Â 
Her goal isnâ€™t speed. Itâ€™s clarity.
